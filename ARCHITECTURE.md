# Architecture

## Purpose

Maestro orchestrates Otto graph workflows, AI discovery, provider routing, and runtime governance across the Otto ecosystem.

## Responsibilities

- Own Runtime orchestration, graph execution, discovery, registry, and observability.
- Publish explicit contracts and extension points.
- Integrate with the Otto ecosystem through registered services and commands.
- Document state transitions, approval patterns, and recovery flows.

## Out of Scope

- Unrelated product UI or application logic.
- Cross-ecosystem business logic not owned by this repository.
- Hidden platform behaviors outside of the repository contract surface.

## Major Components

- core models and contracts
- feature modules
- service registry integration
- command registration layer
- persistence or state management
- testing and validation layer

## Repository Relationships

This repository relates to the Otto ecosystem as follows:

- consumes Otto shared contracts and services where appropriate
- exposes API surface via command definitions and registration
- integrates with Maestro or other Otto repositories via explicit dependency boundaries

## Dependency Graph

## Data Flow

1. Input enters through the command service or repository API.
2. Feature models validate and normalize the request.
3. Domain services execute the behavior.
4. State and audit records are persisted or emitted.
5. Events are published through the Otto event service.

## Command Flow

- command definitions are registered
- actions are generated into CLI/API surfaces
- approval and validation checks occur before execution
- execution emits events and updates state

## Extension Points

- plugin registration
- alternate implementations behind interfaces
- policy-based permission handling
- snapshot/restore and audit hooks

## Future Plans

- formalize deeper plugin contracts
- expand state recovery and observability
- integrate with broader Otto registry and governance layers
